An modified version of the King's Table can be played with a standard set of billard balls.

The pieces align as follows:
Solids:
1 King
2 Bishop
3 Knight
4 Rook
5 Pawn
6 Pawn
7 Pawn
8 Pawn

Stripes:
9 King
10 Bishop
11 Knight
12 Rook
13 Pawn
14 Pawn
15 Pawn
Cue Pawn

Each piece moves the same as in the full version except for the King which can be
used for offense and has the same abilities as the Queen from the full version.

The game ends when a King is pocketted.

Racking: 

R  K  B  k      4  1  2  3
p  p  p  p      5  6  7  8
             > 
p  p  p  p      13 14 15 C
R  K  B  k      12 9  10 11

When racking the balls be sure the pawns are no more than a ball width apart.
