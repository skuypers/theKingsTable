# theKing'sTable
Original rules and designs created by: Steven Kuypers

Billiards and Chess combine in this new challenging game that requires skill and strategy.

The game requires a custome set of billiard balls.
Design files are included here and are formatted to be printed using an EggBot/SphereBot through inkscape.
Individual piece designs can also be sent to a custom billiard ball supplier to produce a more durable professional set.

View the King's Table Rules .pdf for a description of the abilities and restrictions of each piece as well as their starting positions.
